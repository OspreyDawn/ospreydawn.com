                    	<p>I&#8217;ve known Adobe Illustrator and how to use it for years now, but I&#8217;ve never truly mastered it or bothered to dig into it for no reason other than I haven&#8217;t needed to. But as a fan of glyphs, logos, typography and other outlets of graphic design I&#8217;ve always felt the need to tackle it. Every now and then I&#8217;d attempt it but wouldn&#8217;t take it far enough or else wouldn&#8217;t have the time to really give it a decent attempt. Until a year ago.</p>

<p>Born out of procrastination I redesigned a select few NFL team logos. Looking back on them, they were okay, but nothing amazing. I didn&#8217;t spend a great deal of time on them but shared them with the r/NFL community on Reddit anyway to gauge their reactions. Overall the response was positive. Some loved them. Others were apathetic or disappointed that their team wasn&#8217;t properly represented. Most just wanted to see what their team might look like through my eyes. </p>

<p>So I thought to myself—if I want to get better at my hobby, what better way than to tackle the entire league of logos?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of the NFL since &#8217;06 (I&#8217;m not from the States) and the aesthetics have always been one of the sport&#8217;s drawcards for me. But as I&#8217;m pretty sure is the case with most people who call themselves designers, no matter what we see out there, we always think we can do a better job. </p>

<p>NFL logos are a funny business. Some have remained the same for generations while others change regularly, but for the most part the underlying theme of the team has stayed the same for all. Not just in name but in the visuals.</p>

<p>The Denver Broncos logo pre&#8211;1997 and their look after back-to-back Super Bowl titles may be substantially different from one another, yet their visual themes are the same. Naturally both feature horses, but the underlying positioning of them, their threatening stature and expression are the stronger visual cues that are carried across in each, despite their initial visual differences. The team&#8217;s personality is maintained in both. An example of a good redesign in my opinion; a homage to what came before it and taking pride in the team’s history while still galloping forward.</p>

<p>There are many teams in the NFL with good logos, strong visually that have stood the test of time and through the many changing visual trends over the years. There are also a lot of really crap ones. But every logo has a history and a fan base that clings to it. </p>

<p>When I approach design, I rarely design purely for myself; the catalyst may be of my own ambitions but in the end I design for other people. I get joy out of delighting others with what I create. With that in mind, I set myself parameters for this challenge based on the target audience. Or rather audiences. </p>

<p>32 different teams, 32 different sets of fans, 32 themes, 32 personalities, 32 stories and 32 lines of history. 32 different cities and landmarks. 32 different names. If I was going to do this right by me I would have to do it right by the 32 legacies of the league and stay true to their roots and do right by their followers.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not making these for me, I&#8217;m making them for you, the fans. Not an easy task but the perfect exercise in both practical and theoretical design. As such I wont redesign any logo with an inappropriate style e.g. abstract, minimalist or vintage or any of that sort unless it is absolutely the best option. I will retain the current colour schemes of each team. Basically I am giving myself this task: design each NFL team logo as if you have been approached by the said team with or without the respective fan base&#8217;s knowledge.</p>

<p>A daunting task, but I always did like a challenge. Plus the offseason is excruciating and this seemed the perfect fit. I even had a deadline.</p>

<p>I am also very aware there are teams whose logos are the stuff of legend, but I&#8217;m challenging myself here and so I am challenging you: would you be happy if your beloved team&#8217;s logo were one of my creations?</p>

<p>My attempts may disgust you, or they may delight you. I know I can&#8217;t please everybody but if I&#8217;ve done my job right you&#8217;ll be able to see where I came from regardless. Either way don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know what you think, they are for you after all.</p>

<p>Below is the result of work I have done in my own time over the past 5 months, enjoy.</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<p>Sports logos have a very distinctive style and even then the style is narrowed further the more geographically specific you get as well. Baseball tends to be restricted to typographic glyphs, soccer almost exclusively uses the coat of arms motif. For the NFL, it&#8217;s a little bit of all of them, but football teams in general tend toward strong graphics in motion in some way. Below are few examples of logos and styles that I drew inspiration from before getting into the nitty gritty.</p>

<h3>NFC North</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCN-Chicago.jpg" alt="The Chicago Bears" />
</div>

<h4>Chicago Bears</h4>

<p>The Bears are one of the oldest and most decorated of teams in the NFL and have retained their signature navy blue and orange look for as long as they have been on the gridiron. For the most part their logo has remained unchanged with them; but one of my little grievances has always been because of this fact. They are the namesake of one the most fearsome mammals in the United States, yet none of their on-field imagery reflects this. </p>

<p>I am fully aware of the alternate logo, but it seems like a waste to squander such an opportunity to have it in the primary imagery. But alas, with the time that has passed the orange &#8220;C&#8221; has been etched forever into history. Its legacy will never fade and it would be disrespectful to discard it completely.  And therein lay the challenge—to make a logo that retained and honoured the team’s history but with more relevant imagery to their ursine brethren.</p>

<p>With any logo, there must be a key iconic shape so that even from a distance that element stands out above all and is instantly recognisable. Right from the beginning of developing this logo I knew I wanted the Chicago &#8220;C&#8221; to remain that key shape. Right from the beginning I wanted to use the &#8220;C&#8221; to form the teeth of the bear to visually pair the city and it&#8217;s team with one of the bear&#8217;s deadliest weapons. It took a few iterations to get it just right but overall the main idea never changed.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCN-GreenBay.jpg" alt="The Green Bay Packers" />
</div>

<h4>Green Bay Packers</h4>

<p>The hardest part in making these logos is not the creation of them. Making them is comparatively easy once you know what you&#8217;re doing. The hardest and longest part by far is coming up with the right idea. Sometimes it comes straight away and teams with more specific names only make it easier. For others, it can be brain numbingly difficult. The Green Bay Packers are one such example.</p>

<p>Their logo, the bold green &#8220;G&#8221; is unwavering and has stood the test of time. Their fans share the same qualities; proud and loyal. That’s when I realised, the logo shouldn&#8217;t be a representation of the name (beside the obvious reason of being decidedly awkward) but a testament to the legacy of the team, its history and its home. </p>

<p>The Packers are an embodiment of the history of Wisconsin and it makes sense to pay homage to it. Looking back at what logos came before the &#8220;G&#8221; and the theme is present there too. It only makes sense to continue it. The logo is the state of Wisconsin with a star marking the location of Green Bay overlaid with an interlocking glyph of the letters &#8220;G&#8221; and &#8220;B.&#8221; Really the logo borrows multiple elements from older logos and different variations put together as a testament to the history of Green Bay.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCN-Minnesota.jpg" alt="The Minnesota Vikings" />
</div>

<h4>Minnesota Vikings</h4>

<p>The NFL is home to probably the best team naming conventions I know of. Which makes it all the more disappointing when a logo misses that opportunity. Not to say the Vikings’ logo is lacking, just a missed opportunity. With a football team logo in this series, I&#8217;ll try to pay homage to that team&#8217;s home if possible: be it the origin of the name, the geography of the area or some fan association with an emotion or trait that comes with supporting their team. The Vikings were pretty easy in that regard; the name is a homage to Minnesotans’ Scandinavian heritage.</p>

<p>What emotions are associated and traits are associated with the image of a Viking? Ferocity? Stoic solidness? Battle-hardened awareness? All of the above, I believe. Clearly the logo should be a Viking itself, but what pose? What central image? After a bit of Google image searching and research another quick realisation came to mind: The letter V can easily become the collar piece of armor and the cape to finish the shape and become the letter M, all the while placing the Viking standing in a proud, fearless and stoic pose honouring Minnesota&#8217;s heritage. </p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCN-Detroit.jpg" alt="The Detroit Lions" />
</div>

<h4>Detroit Lions</h4>

<p>The Detroit Lions I feel are on the right track with their current logo, much like a fair few of other existing logos, but the devil is in the detail, the expressiveness in the execution. I was tempted a few times to focus on the face of the lion or follow in the generic path of an ornamental lion one would see on a coat of arms or some such thing. </p>

<p>But NFL team logos are about pride or intimidation. Football is a brutal sport and intimidation is key in all things NFL. The best course of action I believed for the Lions was to bring more fluidity and ferocity into the lion; to make it seem as if it were jumping out of the helmet, over the O-Line and to the QB. One of the things I learned greatly from the many iterations I made of this logo was, apart from grasping perspective in motion, knowing just how much and how little detail to put in. The Lions logo was one of the later logos I finished so at this point it was almost second nature but each iteration of the logo was a reminder of how delicate the balancing act is between adding too much and leaving out too little.</p>

<h3>NFC South</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCS-NewOrleans.jpg" alt="The New Orleans Saints" />
</div>

<h4>New Orleans Saints</h4>

<p>I like the Saints logo as is to be honest. It&#8217;s simple, clear and already speaks volumes about New Orleans and its history in a succinct manner. However, I came into the design of this logo prepared. Looking at the logo with the challenge to redesign it, I saw an opportunity. </p>

<p>Obviously I didn&#8217;t want to change too much, the fleur de lis remains, aside from a slight sprucing-up in detail to give it a golden metallic finish, to further drive home the city&#8217;s heredity. The most obvious change in this logo is also my favourite part about it - the figure of a saint at the bottom which fits in seamlessly with the shape of the fleur de lis with no extra tweaking on my part. Plus the added bonus of the golden collar around the neck does a good job of visually pairing the team with the logo to allude to the players as saints themselves bring hope and joy to a city in troubled times.</p>

<p>Even if that was years ago and that comparison is up for debate at present. %controversy.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCS-Atlanta.jpg" alt="The Atlanta Falcons" />
</div>

<h4>Atlanta Falcons</h4>

<p>The Atlanta Falcons logo is a good example of a logo that means well and its intent is strong but the executions is debatably suspect. The falcon poised for attack in the shape of a letter &#8220;F?&#8221; Absolutely brilliant. The actual design itself? Not so much, yet it’s still a slick attempt. If you actually take time to read the logo it becomes very hard to tell if the bird was even a falcon if the team name weren&#8217;t so synonymous with it and the &#8220;F&#8221; is barely visible. I wanted to change that. Birds of such menace and awe deserve better.</p>

<p>To be fair I struggled to accomplish the task. I tried a few other angles to look at the bird to at least make some kind of point of difference between myself and what came before. Truth be told the initial position was as good as it was going to get. Even then, that took a while getting right. After numerous attempts and fervent study of the Falcon itself I think I&#8217;ve achieved what would have to be one of my favourite logos out of the lot in terms of a synchronous bond between technical execution and visual themes. The falcon and the &#8220;F&#8221; are clearly distinguishable.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCS-Carolina.jpg" alt="The Carolina Panthers" />
</div>

<h4>Carolina Panthers</h4>

<p>There was the notion that the Carolina Panthers logo is based off the outline of the combined borders of the North and South Carolina states. It seems a bit of a stretch (the wikipedia article has since been altered with the factoid removed) but it makes for a good starting point. Really all I wanted to do with the Panthers logo was to spruce it up like every other team whose logo is that of an animal, but the prospect of making the logo in to the shape of the states in a more clearer way made for a good challenge too.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the Carolina states as they are look anything but a Panther&#8217;s head but it was surprising how little I really had to change in order to fit it all together. It may not be a complete representation but it made for a good starting point and in the end we still end up with a more ferocious-looking panther.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCS-TampaBay.jpg" alt="The Tampa Bay Buccaneers" />
</div>

<h4>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</h4>

<p>Tampa was one of the original few designs I did earlier that inspired the full team run of this logo redesign series and in turn one of the main reason I chose to redo it again. A peculiar thing happened when I last presented the older logos. In most cases the majority of NFL fans liked the logos I had done… except for the fans of the said team for each respective logo. After a bit of digging, questioning and listening it was blatantly clear each fan base has a distinct association they have with their team, their name and what they represent. Which is fair, they should know, it&#8217;s their team. If the fan base doesn&#8217;t like what I&#8217;ve made for them then I haven&#8217;t done my job right. So I took it as a further challenge which was another driving factor for doing this whole thing.</p>

<p>With my initial design I thought I was being clever putting a cutlass encased in a black skull to look like its mouth. The problem, the fans said, there was nothing in the logo from a first glance that elicits the notion of &#8220;pirates.&#8221; I went straight in with the assumption that what I had was enough but sure enough, I feel the fans were right. Plus had all the fans been happy the rest of these logos might not have been as thoroughly thought out.</p>

<p>While restarting with the Buccaneers I found an interesting quote about the old Bucs logo:</p>

<p><i>Sports writer and commentator Nick Bakay once said that Buccaneer Bruce [the old logo] was a pirate who &#8220;struck fear in the hearts of no one.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>I found this quite humorous and thought, since the Bucs have seen one side of the pirate, why not try to go for the other, darker side? I wanted this new logo to scare the crap out of the other team in the same way the jolly roger would as it would appear bearing out of the ocean mist. I tried multiple different angles, looked a variety of different skulls and positions all trying to achieve that sense of horror. What I ended up with achieves that I think, even if the skull seems a bit sadistic—I guess it just adds to the effect. And of course the tricorne and cutlasses for extra added pirate imagery. It’s as if Buccaneer Brice came back from the dead to make Bakay eat his words.
 
<h3>NFC East</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCE-NewYork.jpg" alt="The New York Giants" />
</div>

<h4>New York Giants</h4>

<p>Ah, the New York Giants. My favourite team. I&#8217;ve been following these guys since 2006 and my passion for the game and team has only grown ever since, even if they have increased the my chances of heart failure in later life. As I&#8217;ve followed the team I feel more confident in my understanding of what makes the Giants who they are in terms of their history and personality. Which is also what made them one of the hardest teams to redesign a logo for. That lower case &#8220;N&#8221; and &#8220;Y&#8221; is too damn iconic. It speaks volume of the team and who they are and too often in the early stages of this logo design process I often forgot it. Which is probably why I left it close to the end; I wanted to do it right, not just for me or the fans but for the team. Plus it wouldn&#8217;t be fair to the other teams if I left it as is.</p>

<p>Initially I started with your obvious starting points like how could an image of a Giant fit into the logo? Does the old logo from way back have any new merit or life in a new form? No, not from what I could conjure up. What about the skyscrapers? The inspiration for the team name? Close, but not quite. What I was forgetting was what made the simple lower case initials so great. The fact that it&#8217;s simple. The Giants organisation is one with a very well-known reputation of being no-frills and with only one focus: football. Funny how some organisations forget that but maybe it&#8217;s not entirely their fault. The media is quick to remind us fans that the Giants are quite the boring organisation to follow and we&#8217;re content with that. Proud even.</p>

<p>So with that realisation the idea for the new logo was clear: keep it simple, and what’s more simple than typographic glyphs? And so I chose to maintain the initials at the central focus. But it has to be a redesign and I still wanted to capture the essence of the city I&#8217;d most like to visit in the States. Sprawling, chaotic and overlapping yet still able to hold itself together under all the weight of its infrastructure. What I designed I feel best represents that feeling of fragile order fighting against the chaos while still keeping the simple, focused mantra of the team&#8217;s personality at heart.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCE-Washington.jpg" alt="The Washington Redskins" />
</div>

<h4>Washington Redskins</h4>

<p>Well it was going to be controversial either way. At least with the Chiefs you can have some leeway. I&#8217;m not here to start an argument though, it’s a name that has been around for ages, has stuck and I don&#8217;t think will change anytime soon. The Redskins name means well despite having the subtleness of a cinder block through a window, so I tried to follow in its intention: to honour a proud people.</p>

<p>I did consider the return of the spear as an option but what are you really hiding? Better to tackle the issue head-on (oh the puns). A proud Native American in a respectful, noble pose is what I wanted to use and a key shape to tie it all together, that shape being the letter &#8220;R&#8221;. </p>

<p>I can be quite stubborn in certain situations, this whole exercise being one of them. If I have an idea that I think is clever I&#8217;ll keep attempting it in the hope that it will work out. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t but this time I was fortunate. I drew multiple iterations of the face from different angles trying to conform to the letter. If it&#8217;s to blatantly obvious to what I&#8217;m trying to do so that each motif is compromised in the attempt then I won&#8217;t use it. Poor executions of intertwining elements means it becomes cheesy, unintelligent and at the very least, putrid. But after many sketches (most horrible) I hit a stroke of luck and the result is what you see.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCE-Dallas.jpg" alt="The Dallas Cowboys" />
</div>

<h4>Dallas Cowboys</h4>

<p>It pains me to admit that the Cowboys were the first logo where I feel like I nailed the styling of the logos moving forward (it was the first one, period), but I&#8217;m a football fan first and a Giants fan second. If I do a shit job of my rivals logos on purpose then I&#8217;m a shit football fan and despite my hate for this team goddamn do I respect them. I hope they go under .250 this season. Every season.</p>

<p>The Dallas blue star is up there with the rest as one of the iconic symbols of football. How do you improve upon something so simple? You don&#8217;t, but I had this idea and I wanted to try it out, and it worked out as perfectly as I hoped it would. It&#8217;s one of the few times where the translation from my mind to execution was seamless (excuse me from blowing my own trumpet I&#8217;m just pretty happy with it). Don&#8217;t change something iconic if you can help it. The star remains as the focus—all I did was slap Clint Eastwood&#8217;s face in there in a way that didn&#8217;t interfere with the key shape. It&#8217;s stoic and bold, much like the Cowboys’ history itself.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCE-Philadelphia.jpg" alt="The Philadelphia Eagles" />
</div>

<h4>Philadelphia Eagles</h4>

<p>There are aspects to the current Eagles logo that I like. If there is any current logo that embodies the theme of ‘90s logos throughout American sports I think this does a good job of hitting all the check marks. What don&#8217;t I like about it? It&#8217;s pretty nitpicky but every time I look at it I feel like something is off—the proportions seem off and the features that make an eagle seem ever so slightly skewed. The trouble of replicating life to a closer degree only brings greater technical criticism.</p>

<p>To be honest I only know this because I fell into the same trap myself when making the logo. I tried revisiting the vintage design to bring it new life, or to try and bring my own clever subtle &#8220;E&#8221; somewhere in there, but I couldn&#8217;t find it. I either struggled to find that clear shape or added too much detail and sometimes I couldn&#8217;t get one without the other. I still want to give Philly a more original take but it was taking too long for this project. That doesn&#8217;t mean I wan&#8217;t happy with what I made. </p>

<p>What I ended up deciding on is very similar to what the Eagles already have. The key shape if it&#8217;s not apparent is that the overall logo is in the shape of a football and the eagle is facing upwards in a more noble, &#8217;Murica kind of way rather than the preying on the weak position. A more fitting image I think Philadelphia should probably strive for considering the city&#8217;s history (I kid).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m doing you a favour Philly.</p>

<h3>NFC West</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCW-Seattle.jpg" alt="The Seattle Seahawks" />
</div>

<h4>Seattle Seahawks</h4>

<p>The Seahawks logo looks nothing like an osprey. That&#8217;s my biggest gripe with the logo (I wonder why that is?). Other than that it has to be one of my current favourites. I love the homage to the Native American ancestry without being offensive (as far as I can tell). With my iteration I tried to retain that styling as much as I could while still trying to make it look like an osprey for obvious reasons. The little flick at one end is more to allude the overall shape to that of a football (like the Eagles one) but also does a nice job of visually pairing the image with the city of Seattle and its geography.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCW-SanFrancisco.jpg" alt="The San Francisco 49ers" />
</div>

<h4>San Francisco 49ers</h4>

<p>This logo hasn&#8217;t changed from the first iteration I did of it over 1 year ago. Why? Because I still feel it hits the nail on the head when it comes to honoring the time of the 1849 gold rush and the miners who made it a part of San Francisco history. </p>

<p>The interlocking &#8220;S&#8221; and &#8220;F&#8221; remain and serve a quadrant that makes the whole logo come together to look like a refurbished old-timey club logo. A bit hipster-ish maybe, but it still fits the bill in my mind. I have seen other iterations that try to force the pick axe into the name somehow and every time I tried to do my own take I couldn&#8217;t convince myself it was a good idea. What I&#8217;ve done is simple and to the point and from what I&#8217;ve understood from the organisation and fans that&#8217;s precisely the look I was aiming for.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCW-StLouis.jpg" alt="The St. Louis Rams" />
</div>

<h4>St. Louis Rams</h4>

<p>Personally I feel the Rams have the greatest get-up in the league at the moment but the logo has always come off as borderline corny. Rams are fierce creatures and I think the current logo kind of makes it comical that when a ram gets pissed it becomes crazy stupid. I tried to give the Rams logo more subtlety with its ferocity, to make it intimidating as it stares down upon its enemies, plus I couldn&#8217;t resist making an inkling of the letter &#8220;R&#8221; out of the horns. It seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/NFCW-Arizona.jpg" alt="The Arizona Cardinals" />
</div>

<h4>Arizona Cardinals</h4>

<p>Like the Browns and Lions, I feel sorry for Arizona. Such staunch and loyal the fans must be to muster the season knowing it may not end well for so many years. The outlook is good for Arizona now, despite the ridiculously difficult division they find themselves in. I wanted to give them a an upgrade on the logo they currently have, though making a cardinal look threatening isn&#8217;t easy. </p>

<p>I was tempted to try something more tricky like fitting the cardinal shape in to the letter &#8220;A&#8221; but the more I thought about it the more I just wanted to stay true to what came before and give something for the fans to hold on to. The current logo does look a bit goofy and the cardinal is a bit of a hard sell against a team name like say the Bears or Titans and even I was surprised at how well a staunch cardinal turned out. </p>

<p>I hope the fans like it as much as I do.</p>

<h3>AFC North</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCN-Baltimore.jpg" alt="The Baltimore Ravens" />
</div>

<h4>Baltimore Ravens</h4>

<p>The design I had in mind for the Baltimore Ravens kind of dissipated the more I worked on but overall turned out to work quite well. My main gripe with the current one was the lack of subtlety in the giant &#8220;B&#8221; on the side of the Raven’s head, which does the rest of the logo a disservice. I also thought to myself, why not make the the raven itself more scary in the same vein as Poe&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>Initially I tried to make the highlights on the raven into the shape of an &#8220;R&#8221; but there was only so much detail I could put in before it became too much. I&#8217;m still happy with what I&#8217;ve ended up with and the &#8220;R&#8221; is still there if you can stretch your imagination a bit but I still have a bit of a nagging feeling to come back and give this one another shot at some point, hell I may do that some for some others, but if kept changing things I&#8217;d never finish.</p>

<p>Ah the life of a perfectionist is a bitch.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCN-Pittsburgh.jpg" alt="The Pittsburgh Steelers" />
</div>

<h4>Pittsburgh Steelers</h4>

<p>Pittsburgh quite possibly has one of the crappiest logos out of the current crop of NFL teams. That&#8217;s my opinion and yes, I&#8217;m well aware of its use (it’s a steel-mark used on Pittsburgh steel) and history but that doesn&#8217;t give it a pass in today&#8217;s landscape. Does that mean I should steer away from it entirely? No, I don&#8217;t think so. Initial concepts that I came up with saw to that. Much like the Giants, any logo I made that was more literal to the namesake of the team felt off and didn&#8217;t belong. </p>

<p>The logo, much like the one I did for the 49ers, is very much the same as the one I did for this team a year ago, but I really didn&#8217;t like the yellow background it relied on. The three lines were made to signify rigidity of the team and the steel the city was built from while in the shape of the letter &#8220;E&#8221; and providing an outlet to pay homage to the old logo, no matter how ugly it is.</p>

<p>I remember clearly before I did too much research into it, one Steeler&#8217;s fan asked if the three lines were representative of the three rivers that ran through Pittsburgh. I said no, it wasn&#8217;t but it&#8217;s definitely an interpretation I can get behind.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCN-Cincinnati.jpg" alt="The Cincinnati Bengals" />
</div>

<h4>Cincinnati Bengals</h4>

<p>The Bengals primary logo, the black and orange striped &#8220;B,&#8221; is just what it is. Not very exciting. The alternate logo, the face of a tiger itself, is better but it still looks like a dude with tiger face paint on. I experimented loosely with trying to subtly include the letter &#8220;B&#8221; in the stripes somehow but I never really had much confidence in that approach. These sort of things usually stick out more quickly than not. So I opted to go down a route that combined both aspects of the original two logos the Bengals use. The overall shape of the logo fits loosely to the letter &#8220;C&#8221; with an intimidating pose of the tiger looking like it’s about to land the final strike on its prey.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCN-Cleveland.jpg" alt="The Cleveland Browns" />
</div>

<h4>Cleveland Browns</h4>

<p>Giving the Browns a logo is kind of like trying to give an alcoholic water: they&#8217;re not going to take it and will give you a weird, dismissive look afterwards. But I&#8217;m going to do it anyway. I&#8217;m not going to try and put it on a helmet though, that&#8217;s probably going too far. </p>

<p>The logo is simply a bull mastiff&#8217;s head looking out in an aggressive fashion. The dog, as most Cleveland fans will undoubtably know, is a reference to the defense being called &#8220;the Dawgs&#8221; and of course the &#8220;Dawg Pound.&#8221; As an added bonus, I kept the old Browns logo I did in the logo type, the letter &#8220;O&#8221; emphasised to look like a buckeye nut, a reference to the Ohio state tree and the name of the Brown&#8217;s first head coach (and the team&#8217;s namesake) Paul Brown&#8217;s first team the Buckeyes.</p>

<h3>AFC South</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCS-Houston.jpg" alt="The Houston Texans" />
</div>

<h4>Houston Texans</h4>

<p>I like the Houston Texans simply because they&#8217;re the other Texas team. But what the hell is a Texan anyway? A person from Texas? In all seriousness, there isn&#8217;t too much that can be done with the source material to fit into a sports logo and what they have already is a decent enough iteration. I was tempted to use the star as the central image but there&#8217;s already another Texas team that has first possession of that and the team already has a strong association with the bull—to deviate would be a disservice.</p>

<p>The logo is, essentially, a more realistic and irate version of the original Texans bull. I even managed to keep the star in the logo in a way that wasn&#8217;t too gaudy and unnecessary. My only concern would be that it might look too much like the Chicago Bulls to some but I think it has enough difference in the style, angle and colours to differentiate itself.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCS-Indianapolis.jpg" alt="The Indianapolis Colts" />
</div>

<h4>Indianapolis Colts</h4>

<p>I really wanted to do something besides the obvious for the Colts. I tried being clever with the main image being a horse with its hooves exposed to show the horseshoe as a &#8220;C&#8221;, but there was no clean angle to be found out of all the sketches I did. In the end I resorted to making the horseshoe slightly more realistic in appearance and rotated it 90º to look like the letter &#8220;C.&#8221; </p>

<p>The Colts are another one of those teams where the logo is too iconic to change drastically and to change the theme too much would render the team unrecognisable. Another driving factor in the development of these designs is that if the fans of the NFL and their teams can&#8217;t instantly recognise the logos and what team they belong to without context then I&#8217;ve missed the point.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCS-Jacksonville.jpg" alt="The Jacksonville Jaguars" />
</div>

<h4>Jacksonville Jaguars</h4>

<p>One main complaint I got from Jaguars fans with the logo I did for them a year ago was that it didn&#8217;t look like a Jaguar from first glance, it could have been any cat. I sacrificed quality of the logo with the need to be clever by trying to make the head look like the letter &#8220;J&#8221; and in turn making nobody happy. So, like the original itself, I set out to redo it and make it look like a jaguar and maybe throw in a subtle letter &#8220;J&#8221; if I could. </p>

<p>I had actually settled on a design beforehand, it was one of the first 5 months ago. The funny thing was as I progressed through doing all the other teams, I was getting noticeably better technically and the original looked out of place so I had to redo it. In terms of execution the current design of mine for the Jaguars has to be up there as one of my favourites. I designed it after the Jags revealed their new logo this year, so I listened to that criticism too and made sure mine didn&#8217;t look cartoony like the new one or disproportionate like the older one. There&#8217;s even a little &#8220;J&#8221; in the tongue so it managed to all work out.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCS-Tennessee.jpg" alt="The Tennessee Titans" />
</div>

<h4>Tennessee Titans</h4>

<p>Tennessee Titans, the team of the flaming thumb tack. Another example in my mind of a team in need of a logo that represents the name and character of the team in a more relevant and imposing manner. In my initial attempt, I tried to steer clear from the stereotypical inclusion of the sword as the letter &#8220;T&#8221; as the focal point of the logo, mainly because at that time I was experimenting and short on time. </p>

<p>My first attempts at the using the sword weren&#8217;t much to look at but after giving it a second go I think I hit the jackpot. The main issue that I found was that any logo that wasn&#8217;t in profile came off unbalanced especially if the shape of the logo was tall and narrow which wouldn&#8217;t work well on a helmet. It&#8217;s funny how much difference something as small as adding a cape to something can make. I even kept the three red stars representing east, middle and west Tennessee respectively, like the state flag.</p>

<h3>AFC East</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCE-NewEngland.jpg" alt="The New England Patriots" />
</div>

<h4>New England Patriots</h4>

<p>As a Giants fan, I don&#8217;t hate the Patriots. I respect the hell out of the organisation to be frank, but I&#8217;m well aware of the hate directed my way and I can understand. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s well deserved staining history like that. I lived with a Patriots fan from Rhode Island for a year once. The first thing she said to me when I met her was &#8220;we can&#8217;t be friends.&#8221; Fours years later I guess I proved her wrong. She&#8217;s since left New Zealand and is continuing her study in Canada so this one&#8217;s for her, her family and the rest of the Patriots’ fan base.</p>

<p>From what I&#8217;ve observed from Patriots fans on the subject of their current logo, the response has been decidedly mixed. Myself and my Patriot friend are quite fond of the current one where as others can&#8217;t get the image of a flying Elvis head out of their mind. Right from the get-go I had a starting shape to build off. </p>

<p>I was convinced I could get a minute man in the position of the letter &#8220;P&#8221; charging into battle with the old Betsy Ross US flag. The &#8220;P&#8221; is very loosely visible but it served well as an initial shape and I think I was able to strike a good balance between bringing together the return of Pat the Patriot and the current style while striking the great theme of charging into the battlefield that is the gridiron every Sunday.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCE-NewYork.jpg" alt="The New York Jets" />
</div>

<h4>New York Jets</h4>

<p>Oh the Jets, what a history they&#8217;ve had and their recent escapades haven&#8217;t been too kind in the least. I still hate them, but I do feel sorry for them. No one deserves that. I hope this logo cheers them up. </p>

<p>It took me a while to get it right but right from the beginning I knew I could make the wing of the Jet look like a &#8220;J&#8221; if I just got the angle right. I even brought back the old Jets logotype because I thought the speed it gave off was a perfect fit in with the jet itself. To be honest I&#8217;m quite chuffed with the result, it looks awesome on a helmet and I hope the fans get a kick out of it. </p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCE-Buffalo.jpg" alt="The Buffalo Bills" />
</div>

<h4>Buffalo Bills</h4>

<p>With their current logo, the Buffalo Bills could legitimately pass off as the Laser Bisons. Not that it&#8217;s a bad thing but it sends mixed messages. It&#8217;s also a very hard name to start with too, Buffalo is the city, the team is called the Bills, named after the famous Buffalo hunter. It&#8217;s as if shooting themselves is running theme considering their recent history. </p>

<p>But enough with the jokes: I of course mean no ill will and legitimately have sympathy for them. To have been to four consecutive Super Bowls only to lose to each team in the NFC East (except the Eagles, can&#8217;t forget that fact) with only the Vikings to know an inkling of their pain. </p>

<p>I had no idea where to begin with this one so I looked to the past and other renditions some other designers had done. One interesting angle was focusing on the Buffalo skull as a reference to Buffalo Bill himself. I experimented a bit with it but nothing was forthcoming enough to really get me excited about it. What did really inspire me was an old Buffalo Bills logo I found that had a Buffalo charging with a football player next to him playing the role of half back. It also looked as if the Buffalo was the player&#8217;s spirit animal which was an idea I really took a liking to. </p>

<p>I decided to completely refurbish the old logo to give it a modern feel and give the player better proportions as I felt it still had the best fit for the Bills, as there is strength in the Bills fans spirit to be loyal for so long and through so many hardships.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCE-Miami.jpg" alt="The Miami Dolphins" />
</div>

<h4>Miami Dolphins</h4>

<p>The Dolphins logo here is essentially the same as the one I did a year ago albeit a good example of what a difference 5 months of sparingly dedicated time can do to one&#8217;s technical skills. The Dolphins had their new logo arrive this year too while I was in the process of making my own. </p>

<p>While I think the new one is a nice rendition, it&#8217;s lost a bit of its character present in the previous goofy football-helmet-touting dolphin. I wanted to find a middle ground, after all making a dolphin intimidating is quite the challenge. The dolphin&#8217;s shape is loosely in the shape of the letter &#8220;D&#8221; and the colours have been updated to the new ones. I&#8217;ve made it look as threatening as I could without it coming off too cheesy and/or ridiculous.</p>

<h3>AFC West</h3>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCW-Denver.jpg" alt="The Denver Broncos" />
</div>

<h4>Denver Broncos</h4>

<p>The Broncos logo was one I purposefully left to worry about near the end. It was something I&#8217;d keep attempting over the months but I wouldn&#8217;t get anywhere. I knew something was there to be found but it took the whole 5 months before I finally did find anything. I tried mixing it up, going back and forth between something like the old logo to others that were completely different to trying to find a way to put a &#8220;D&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; in there somewhere. The fact it took me so long to look to the geography of Denver before it clicked still annoys me. </p>

<p>The initial inspiration came from the Appalachian Mountaineers logo. The idea of an image in the mountain face of the rockies made perfect sense and it seemed like a no-brainer once I thought about it to make the horse head the image in the mountain and the wisp of clouds billowing over the tops as the mane and eye. From a distance a mountain, up close a horse; the perfect combination of name, locale and the visual themes.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCW-Oakland.jpg" alt="The Oakland Raiders" />
</div>

<h4>Oakland Raiders</h4>

<p>The Raiders fans have quite a reputation, the good side being their fans are devout and eccentric. The fans have become more of a visual defining characteristic of the team especially so since the lack of lustre in their team’s recent performance (I hope Terrell changes that sentiment though). The current logo, while classic, though I feel with slight changes could reflect the fan base and bring in new life to the team in terms of intimidation, which the fans have in droves. </p>

<p>Basically I wanted to keep the basic visuals of the logo the same but update it with Oakland&#8217;s &#8220;colourful&#8221; imagery. The football player is now updated with the slick Riddell helmet and the player a grinning skull. The trouble with skulls is that they can come off quite cheesy if they&#8217;re not done right but as long as the proportions are right you tend to be fine. What I have made, to me (and hopefully Oakland fans too), fits the bill of representing Raiders fandom while ushering in a new feeling of fear.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCW-SanDiego.jpg" alt="The San Diego Chargers" />
</div>

<h4>San Diego Chargers</h4>

<p>I kind of regret the first iteration I made of the Chargers logo. Everyone but the Chargers fans seemed to like it and after listening to what they had to say I felt I had done an inadequate job. What better time than now to fix that sentiment? The main issue with the previous logo I did was that it had no characteristics that resonate with Chargers fans. That&#8217;s the danger of using a modernist approach to sports logo design and a mistake I promised not to make this time around. </p>

<p>The current Chargers logo (heh pun) was one I always found lacking despite the name. The lightning bolt itself doesn&#8217;t seem well executed and like most things, the more general an idea of how we expect them to look the easier it is for them to fall into the goofy/cheesy category of imagery. I looked again to the past and got inspired by the shield and horse iteration. </p>

<p>The result is a horse in the shape of the letter &#8220;C&#8221; with golden highlights in the shape of lightning bolts. Getting the right colour combination was a hassle but ultimately I&#8217;m pretty pleased with this logo (especially the lightning bolt on the forehead) in the way everything blends together without one element taking precedent over the other. The storm horse as I like to call it is up there as one of my favourites and I hope it’s far better suited and up to standard of the Chargers fans themselves.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
    <img src="_include/img/work/blog/AFCW-KansasCity.jpg" alt="The Kansas City Chiefs" />
</div>

<h4>Kansas City Chiefs</h4>

<p>The Chiefs was another logo I did before and had a Native American chief as its centre focus. NFL and Chiefs fans were quick to point out that using the image of a chief has a high chance of being racially insensitive and rightly so (one of the older logos for the team is already quite hilariously racist). If I&#8217;m going to use any Native American imagery I want to use it right and since I don&#8217;t really have access or permission to go that angle further I thought I&#8217;d steer clear.</p>

<p>What I chose to do moving forward was to follow the same lines of the current Chiefs logo, like the 49ers and Packers logo I had done before and also bring in a bit of what I explored in my initial attempt. The &#8220;K&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; glyphs take centre point and I designed the typeface with the intent of being able to slot in the arrow perfectly to make the &#8220;C&#8221; look like a stretched bow. I also had to be careful not to make it look like a letter &#8220;E&#8221; too. Overall, I think the logo does a good job of maintaining the current one while adding some extra modern flair.</p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>Over the course of the past 5 months I&#8217;ve personally learned a great deal: technique, work flow, design principles, visual cohesion, thematic imagery, process—the whole lot. As an amateur artist looking on on many of the great graphic designers that have a great presence online I feel like I&#8217;ve made great strides in moving toward their skill level. </p>

<p>At the beginning, I was doing it for me, but in the end what kept me going and got me excited to do each next iteration was for the fans. I may not make everyone happy but at least I&#8217;m content with my effort and I got a lot out of it. Somehow I feel this is something I&#8217;ll keep coming back to and editing and so forth so if you have any opinions on any of these logos do feel free to let me know. My perfectionism knows no bounds and its what strives all us designers to keep going and make better work.</p>

<p>This whole exercise was born out of the will to self improve and for the love of the sport that is American Football. I hope you enjoyed these logos as much as I did making them.</p>
