Pittsburgh quite possibly has one of the crappiest logos out of the current crop of NFL teams. That's my opinion and yes, I'm well aware of its use (it’s a steel-mark used on Pittsburgh steel) and history but that doesn't give it a pass in today's landscape. Does that mean I should steer away from it entirely? No, I don't think so. Initial concepts that I came up with saw to that. Much like the Giants, any logo I made that was more literal to the namesake of the team felt off and didn't belong. 

The logo, much like the one I did for the 49ers, is very much the same as the one I did for this team a year ago, but I really didn't like the yellow background it relied on. The three lines were made to signify rigidity of the team and the steel the city was built from while in the shape of the letter "E" and providing an outlet to pay homage to the old logo, no matter how ugly it is.

I remember clearly before I did too much research into it, one Steeler's fan asked if the three lines were representative of the three rivers that ran through Pittsburgh. I said no, it wasn't but it's definitely an interpretation I can get behind.
