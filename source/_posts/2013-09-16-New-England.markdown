As a Giants fan, I don't hate the Patriots. I respect the hell out of the organisation to be frank, but I'm well aware of the hate directed my way and I can understand. I'd say it's well deserved staining history like that. I lived with a Patriots fan from Rhode Island for a year once. The first thing she said to me when I met her was "we can't be friends." Fours years later I guess I proved her wrong. She's since left New Zealand and is continuing her study in Canada so this one's for her, her family and the rest of the Patriots’ fan base.

From what I've observed from Patriots fans on the subject of their current logo, the response has been decidedly mixed. Myself and my Patriot friend are quite fond of the current one where as others can't get the image of a flying Elvis head out of their mind. 

Right from the get-go I had a starting shape to build off. I was convinced I could get a minute man in the position of the letter 'P' charging into battle with the old Betsy Ross US flag. The 'P' is very loosely visible but it served well as an initial shape and I think I was able to strike a good balance between bringing together the return of Pat the Patriot and the current style while striking the great theme of charging into the battlefield that is the gridiron every Sunday.
