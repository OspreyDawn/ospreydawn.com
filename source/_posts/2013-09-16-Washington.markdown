Well it was going to be controversial either way. At least with the Chiefs you can have some leeway. I'm not here to start an argument though, it’s a name that has been around for ages, has stuck and I don't think will change anytime soon. The Redskins name means well despite having the subtleness of a cinder block through a window, so I tried to follow in its intention: to honour a proud people.

I did consider the return of the spear as an option but what are you really hiding? Better to tackle the issue head-on (oh the puns). A proud Native American in a respectful, noble pose is what I wanted to use and a key shape to tie it all together, that shape being the letter 'R'. 

I can be quite stubborn in certain situations, this whole exercise being one of them. If I have an idea that I think is clever I'll keep attempting it in the hope that it will work out. Sometimes it doesn't but this time I was fortunate. I drew multiple iterations of the face from different angles trying to conform to the letter. If it's too blatantly obvious as to what I'm trying to do so that each motif is compromised in the attempt then I won't use it. Poor executions of intertwining elements means it becomes cheesy, unintelligent and at the very least, putrid. But after many sketches (most horrible) I hit a stroke of luck and the result is what you see.
