The NFL is home to probably the best team naming conventions I know of. Which makes it all the more disappointing when a logo misses that opportunity. Not to say the Vikings’ logo is lacking, just a missed opportunity. With a football team logo in this series, I'll try to pay homage to that team's home if possible: be it the origin of the name, the geography of the area or some fan association with an emotion or trait that comes with supporting their team. The Vikings were pretty easy in that regard; the name is a homage to Minnesotans’ Scandinavian heritage. 

What emotions are associated and traits are associated with the image of a Viking? Ferocity? Stoic solidness? Battle-hardened awareness? All of the above, I believe. Clearly the logo should be a Viking itself, but what pose? What central image? After a bit of Google image searching and research another quick realisation came to mind: The letter 'V' can easily become the collar piece of armor and the cape to finish the shape and become the letter 'M', all the while placing the Viking standing in a proud, fearless and stoic pose honouring Minnesota's heritage.
