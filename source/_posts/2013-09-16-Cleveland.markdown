Giving the Browns a logo is kind of like trying to give an alcoholic water: they're not going to take it and will give you a weird, dismissive look afterwards. But I'm going to do it anyway. I'm not going to try and put it on a helmet though, that's probably going too far.Â 

The logo is simply a bull mastiff's head looking out in an aggressive fashion. The dog, as most Cleveland fans will undoubtably know, is a reference to the defense being called "the Dawgs" and of course the "Dawg Pound." As an added bonus, I kept the old Browns logo I did in the logo type, the letter 'O' emphasised to look like a buckeye nut, a reference to the Ohio state tree and the name of the Brown's first head coach (and the team's namesake) Paul Brown's first team the Buckeyes.
