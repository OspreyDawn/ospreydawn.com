Oh the Jets, what a history they've had and their recent escapades haven't been too kind in the least. I still hate them, but I do feel sorry for them. No one deserves that. I hope this logo cheers them up. 

It took me a while to get it right but from the beginning I knew I could make the wing of the Jet look like a 'J' if I just got the angle right. I even brought back the old Jets logotype because I thought the speed it gave off was a perfect fit in with the jet itself. To be honest I'm quite chuffed with the result, it looks awesome on a helmet and I hope the fans get a kick out of it.
