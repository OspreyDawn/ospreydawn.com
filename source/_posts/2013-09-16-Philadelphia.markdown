There are aspects to the current Eagles logo that I like. If there is any current logo that embodies the theme of ‘90s logos throughout American sports I think this does a good job of hitting all the check marks. What don't I like about it? It's pretty nitpicky but every time I look at it I feel like something is wrong — the proportions seem off and the features that make an eagle seem ever so slightly skewed. The trouble of replicating life to a closer degree only brings greater technical criticism.

To be honest I only know this because I fell into the same trap myself when making the logo. I tried revisiting the vintage design to bring it new life, or to try and bring my own clever subtle "E" somewhere in there, but I couldn't find it. I either struggled to find that clear shape or added too much detail and sometimes I couldn't get one without the other. I still want to give Philly a more original take but it was taking too long for this project. That doesn't mean I wan't happy with what I made. 

What I ended up deciding on is very similar to what the Eagles already have. The key shape if it's not apparent is that the overall logo is in the shape of a football and the eagle is facing upwards in a more noble, 'Murica kind of way rather than the 'preying on the weak' position. A more fitting image I think Philadelphia should probably strive for considering the city's history (I kid).
