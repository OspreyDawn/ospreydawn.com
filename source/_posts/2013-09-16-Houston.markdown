I like the Houston Texans simply because they're the other Texas team. But what the hell is a Texan anyway? A person from Texas? In all seriousness, there isn't too much that can be done with the source material to fit into a sports logo and what they have already is a decent enough iteration. I was tempted to use the star as the central image but there's already another Texas team that has first possession of that and the team already has a strong association with the bull â€” to deviate would be a disservice.

The logo is, essentially, a more realistic and irate version of the original Texans bull. I even managed to keep the star in the logo in a way that wasn't too gaudy and unnecessary. My only concern would be that it might look too much like the Chicago Bulls to some but I think it has enough difference in the style, angle and colours to differentiate itself.
