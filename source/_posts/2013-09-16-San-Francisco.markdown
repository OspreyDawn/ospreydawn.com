This logo hasn't changed from the first iteration I did of it over a year ago. Why? Because I still feel it hits the nail on the head when it comes to honoring the time of the 1849 gold rush and the miners who made it a part of San Francisco history.Â 

The interlocking 'S' and 'F' remain and serve a quadrant that makes the whole logo come together to look like a refurbished old-timey club logo. A bit hipster-ish maybe, but it still fits the bill in my mind. I have seen other iterations that try to force the pick axe into the name somehow and every time I tried to do my own take I couldn't convince myself it was a good idea. What I've done is simple and to the point and from what I've understood from the organisation and fans that's precisely the look I was aiming for.
