The design I had in mind for the Baltimore Ravens kind of dissipated the more I worked on but overall turned out to work quite well. My main gripe with the current one was the lack of subtlety in the giant 'B' on the side of the Ravenâ€™s head, which does the rest of the logo a disservice. I also thought to myself, why not make the the raven itself more scary in the same vein as Poe's story.

Initially I tried to make the highlights on the raven into the shape of an 'R' but there was only so much detail I could put in before it became too much. I'm still happy with what I've ended up with and the 'R' is still there if you can stretch your imagination a bit but I still have a bit of a nagging feeling to come back and give this one another shot at some point, hell I may do that some for some others, but if kept changing things I'd never finish.

Ah the life of a perfectionist is a bitch.
