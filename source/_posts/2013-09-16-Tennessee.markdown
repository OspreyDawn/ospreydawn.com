Tennessee Titans, the team of the flaming thumb tack. Another example in my mind of a team in need of a logo that represents the name and character of the team in a more relevant and imposing manner. In my initial attempt, I tried to steer clear from the stereotypical inclusion of the sword as the letter "T" as the focal point of the logo, mainly because at that time I was experimenting and short on time in general.Â 

My first attempts at the using the sword weren't much to look at but after giving it a second go I think I hit the jackpot. The main issue that I found was that any logo that wasn't in profile came off unbalanced especially if the shape of the logo was tall and narrow which wouldn't work well on a helmet. It's funny how much difference something as small as adding a cape to something can make. I even kept the three red stars representing east, middle and west Tennessee respectively, like the state flag.
