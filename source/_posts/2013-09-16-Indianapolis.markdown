I really wanted to do something besides the obvious for the Colts. I tried being clever with the main image being a horse with its hooves exposed to show the horseshoe as a 'C', but there was no clean angle to be found out of all the sketches I did. In the end I resorted to making the horseshoe slightly more realistic in appearance and rotated it 90º to look like the letter 'C'. 

The Colts are another one of those teams where the logo is too iconic to change drastically and to change the theme too much would render the team unrecognisable. Another driving factor in the development of these designs is that if the fans of the NFL and their teams can't instantly recognise the logos and what team they belong to without context then I've missed the point.
