Personally I feel the Rams have the greatest get-up in the league at the moment but the logo has always come off as borderline corny. Rams are fierce creatures and I think the current logo kind of makes it comical that when a ram gets pissed it becomes crazy stupid. I tried to give the Rams logo more subtlety with its ferocity, to make it intimidating as it stares down upon its enemies, plus I couldn't resist making an inkling of the letter "R" out of the horns. It seemed like too good of an opportunity to pass up.
