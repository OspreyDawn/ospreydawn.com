The Broncos logo was one I purposefully left to worry about near the end. It was something I'd keep attempting over the months but I wouldn't get anywhere. I knew something was there to be found but it took the whole 5 months before I finally did find anything. I tried mixing it up, going back and forth between something like the old logo to others that were completely different to trying to find a way to put a "D" or "B" in there somewhere. The fact it took me so long to look to the geography of Denver before it clicked still annoys me.Â 

The initial inspiration came from the Appalachian Mountaineers logo. The idea of an image in the mountain face of the rockies made perfect sense and it seemed like a no-brainer once I thought about it to make the horse head the image in the mountain and the wisp of clouds billowing over the tops as the mane and eye. From a distance a mountain, up close a horse; the perfect combination of name, locale and the visual themes.
