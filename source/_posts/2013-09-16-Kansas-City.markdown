The Chiefs was another logo I did before and had a Native American chief as its centre focus. NFL and Chiefs fans were quick to point out that using the image of a chief has a high chance of being racially insensitive and rightly so (one of the older logos for the team is already quite hilariously racist). If I'm going to use any Native American imagery I want to use it right and since I don't really have access or permission to go with that angle further I thought I'd steer clear.

What I chose to do moving forward was to follow the same lines of the current Chiefs logo, like the 49ers and Packers logo I had done before and also bring in a bit of what I explored in my initial attempt. The 'K' and 'C' glyphs take centre point and I designed the typeface with the intent of being able to slot in the arrow perfectly to make the 'C' look like a stretched bow. I also had to be careful not to make it look like a letter 'E' too. Overall, I think the logo does a good job of maintaining the current one while adding some extra modern flair.
