I like the Saints logo as is to be honest. It's simple, clear and already speaks volumes about New Orleans and its history in a succinct manner. However, I came into the design of this logo prepared. Looking at the logo with the challenge to redesign it, I saw an opportunity.Â 

Obviously I didn't want to change too much, the fleur de lis remains, aside from a slight sprucing-up in detail to give it a golden metallic finish, to further drive home the city's heredity. The most obvious change in this logo is also my favourite part about it - the figure of a saint at the bottom which fits in seamlessly with the shape of the fleur de lis with no extra tweaking on my part. Plus the added bonus of the golden collar around the neck does a good job of visually pairing the team with the logo to allude to the players as saints themselves who brought hope and joy to a city in troubled times.

Even if that was years ago and that comparison is up for debate at present. %controversy.
