The Bengals primary logo, the black and orange striped 'B', is just what it is. Not very exciting. The alternate logo, the face of a tiger itself, is better but it still looks like a dude with tiger face paint on. I experimented loosely with trying to subtly include the letter "B" in the stripes somehow but I never really had much confidence in that approach. These sort of things usually stick out more quickly than not. So I opted to go down a route that combined both aspects of the original two logos the Bengals use. The overall shape of the logo fits loosely to the letter 'C' with an intimidating pose of the tiger looking like itâ€™s about to land the final strike on its prey.
