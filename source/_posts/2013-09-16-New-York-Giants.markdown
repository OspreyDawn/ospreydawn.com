Ah, the New York Giants. My favourite team. I've been following these guys since 2006 and my passion for the game and team has only grown ever since, even if they have increased the my chances of heart failure in later life. As I've followed the team I feel more confident in my understanding of what makes the Giants who they are in terms of their history and personality. Which is also what made them one of the hardest teams to redesign a logo for. That lower case 'N' and 'Y' is too damn iconic. It speaks volume of the team and who they are and too often in the early stages of this logo design process I often forgot it. Which is probably why I left it close to the end; I wanted to do it right, not just for me or the fans but for the team. Plus it wouldn't be fair to the other teams if I left it as is.

Initially I started with your obvious starting points like how could an image of a Giant fit into the logo? Does the old logo from way back have any new merit or life in a new form? No, not from what I could conjure up. What about the skyscrapers? The inspiration for the team name? Close, but not quite. What I was forgetting was what made the simple lower case initials so great. The fact that it's simple. The Giants organisation is one with a very well-known reputation of being no-frills and with only one focus: football. Funny how some organisations forget that but maybe it's not entirely their fault. The media is quick to remind us fans that the Giants are quite the boring organisation to follow and we're content with that. Proud even.

So with that realisation the idea for the new logo was clear: keep it simple, and whatâ€™s more simple than typographic glyphs? And so I chose to maintain the initials at the central focus. But it has to be a redesign and I still wanted to capture the essence of the city I'd most like to visit in the States. Sprawling, chaotic and overlapping yet still able to hold itself together under all the weight of its infrastructure. What I designed I feel best represents that feeling of fragile order fighting against the chaos while still keeping the simple, focused mantra of the team's personality at heart.
