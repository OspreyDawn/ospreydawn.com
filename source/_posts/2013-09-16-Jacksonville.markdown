One main complaint I got from Jaguars fans with the logo I did for them a year ago was that it didn't look like a Jaguar from first glance, it could have been any cat. I sacrificed quality of the logo with the need to be clever by trying to make the head look like the letter 'J' and in turn making nobody happy. So, like the original itself, I set out to redo it and make it look like a jaguar and maybe throw in a subtle letter 'J' if I could.Â 

I had actually settled on a design beforehand, it was one of the first 5 months ago. The funny thing was as I progressed through doing all the other teams, I was getting noticeably better technically and the original looked out of place so I had to redo it. In terms of execution the current design of mine for the Jaguars has to be up there as one of my favourites. I designed it after the Jags revealed their new logo this year, so I listened to that criticism too and made sure mine didn't look cartoony like the new one or disproportionate like the older one. There's even a little "J" in the tongue so it managed to all work out.
